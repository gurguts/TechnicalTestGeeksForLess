This project, "Mathematical Assistant," is designed to help mathematics teachers. It allows for:

1. Input of mathematical equations with integers or decimals, operators (+ - * /), and parentheses at any nesting level, using 'x' as the variable.
2. Verification of equations for correct parentheses placement and operator sequence.
3. Equation correctness check and storage in a database (DB).
4. Input and verification of equation roots; if valid, they are stored in the DB.
5. Searching the DB for equations by their roots.

For a detailed view of the assignment, see the [Java Basic Course-Test](task/JavaBasicCourse-Test.pdf).

Screenshots of the application in action can be found [here](screenshot).
